# Google Technical Interview Notes / Cheat Sheet

### Do's

#### Before

* Draw from experience from past interviews

* Set timer if interview timed

#### During

* Verbalize your thoughts as you go through each step of the process

* Explain back problem verbally for smoke / sanity test

* Think about problem for ~15-20 seconds before jumping immidiately to psudocode

* Leave plenty of room on the whiteboard

* Find a simple working psudocode idea first, then level up progressive complexity / optimization

* Unit test / test cases

* Analyze complexity of the code

* Use helper functions that demonstate contextual use of program

* Walk through code with instructors and explain how each bit works

* Get a working implementation of code

#### After

* Keep hopes up regardless of outcome. There are 4 different interviews total.

* Ask for feedback on ways to improve

### Dont's

* Don't use overly abstract psudocode

* Don't prematurely optimize code/psudocode. Perfect is the enemy of done


## Interview Workflow:

1. question sanity check
2. brainstorm 
3. basic working case
4. iterate more efficeint solutions
5. psudocode sanity check
6. write program code
6. walk through program 
7. examine test cases
