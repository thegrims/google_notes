test verbally smoke /sanity test

simple example first level up progressive complexity / better

unit test / test cases

analyze complexity of the code

test code by walking through it with instructors and saying how each part works


dont use too abstract psudocode

do use helper functions that demonstates use of program

do draw from experience from past interviews

think about problem before jumping immidiately

dont prematurely optemize

get working solution first


leave plenty of room on the whiteboard

keep timer running

keep hopes up regardless of outcome

ask for feedback

C O M M U N I C A T E !

workflow:

1 question sanity check

2 brainstorm 

3 basic working case

4 iterate more efficeint solutions

5 sanity check

6 walk through program 

7 examine test cases
